A collection of ox based jobs, built from the mi_worktemplate script. This is meant to be a plug and play set of simple jobs for players to be able to do. No boss menus, no business systems. Just get in uniform, get a car, and do the job. Each job includes:
* Custom uniforms *(eup based)*
* Addon vehicles for each job
* Three tasks for each job
* Payouts and salaries
* Teleporters for ipls

## Installing
* Download latest release
* Place *[mi_jobpack]* in resources folder
* insert *job_add.sql* into your database
* insert *ensure [mi_jobpack]* into your cfg *(after ox, pefcl, npwd, and other core resources)*

note: *The vehicles are added in the [vehicle_stream] folder, so you don't need to add or download anything else*with the credits to the creators of the vehicles & liveries*
